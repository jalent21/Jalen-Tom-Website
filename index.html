        Hi my name is Jalen Tom and I am currently a first year student at the University of California Riverside. I was born and raised in Walnut Creek, California, which is in the Northern Side of the state. My ethnicity consists of half Japanese and half Chinese. My mom is originally from Japan and my dad was born in San Francisco. My family consists of four members, my mom, dad, my younger brother, and myself. My extended family on my momâ€™s side all reside in different areas of Japan. On my dadâ€™s side, the majority of our close extended family live in Northern California, with some distant family members living in Canada or other neighboring states. From a young age, I grew a liking for sports. I tried out several of them, including basketball, football, baseball, swimming, and wrestling. A large part of the first half of my life consisted of trying these different activities. I have a fondness for each one in their own way. Although the first half of my youth were spent playing sports like these for club or just for fun, as I reached middle school, I played them less and less. By the time I reached high school, I didnâ€™t play club sports anymore. I did do track and field in my freshman year but I stopped halfway through sophomore year to focus on my studies. As the eldest sibling of the family, many events in my life were test runs for my parents and I. Due to this, a lot of things were learning experiences for me. High school was much more difficult for me compared to middle school, so a lot of my struggles were through trial and error. This made my high school career a bit harder compared to others since I definitely struggled with more than some of my other classmates.Things like time management, studying, or taking notes were things I wasnâ€™t unfamiliar with. These things are also what I am trying to improve today.
<br><br>

        Throughout high school I did a few volunteer type clubs, but I wasnâ€™t super involved like some others. In the summer between my sophomore and junior year, I landed an internship in Japan. I shadowed a manager who was in charge of a factory that produced household goods. I was able to see the assembly line, machinery, and workers all in action. A majority of the time was spent observing and taking notes on what would go on behind the scenes. The rest of the time I did things like filing invoices and stamping bank books. My junior and senior year, during the COVID pandemic, I found a job with an insurance company. For this job, I mainly was assigned specific topics and targeted audiences for a range of types of insurance. My boss would direct me to different potential insurances that could be a great investment. From there I would spend time researching the topic to learn more about it and what the pros and cons of it were. After gathering information, I was assigned to create powerpoint presentations with a specific audience in mind. My boss would use the powerpoints I created to present to his business partners and/or to his clients.
